- always profile your code before optimizing it is required in order to have a **baseline performance.**
- **Sampling profiling**
    - useful when you need to see the **sampling** of methods in the callstack and how much time is **spent** on each of them
    - Non CPU work is not visible! (e.g. Thread.spleep() , I/O Operation)
    - Inclusive **Samples** : samples that contain the method.
    - Exclusive **samples:** samples with the given function on the top of the stack.
- **Instrumentation.**
    - injects code to measure every method and also shows non cpu related work.
    - more detailed
    - more overhead
    - Measures also non CPU Work
