>set of design principles defined by Robert C. Martin.
### Single responsibility
> a class should have one and one reason to change. meaning that a class should have only one job.
### Open closed
>objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov substitution
>if a class A is a subtype of class B, it should be interchangeable with A without disrupting the behavior's of our program.
### Interface segregation
>a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or methods they do not use.
### Dependency inversion
>Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions.

- Promotes decoupling for flexibility and extensibility.
