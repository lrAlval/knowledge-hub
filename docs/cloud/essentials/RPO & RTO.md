## TL;DR
-   Recovery Point Objective (**RPO**) â‡’ 
	-  **max** acceptable data loss.
	- **max** amount of data (**time**) that **can be lost.**
-   Recovery Time Objective (**RTO**) â‡’
	- (**max** acceptable time can **recover operational state**) 
	- **max** tolerable **duration** of a service **outage**.
- *Aim for **Goldilocks*** . 
	- As close to the **TRUE** business requirements as possible.

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

-   **max** amount of data (**time**) that **can be lost.**
-   **Lower RPO** = **More** **Frequent Backups = Expensive Budget \$\$\$ ðŸ’°
-   **Higher RPO** = **Less** Frequent Backups **= Lower Budget \$\$\$ ðŸ’°
-   each back up = Recovery Point (**RP**) â‡’ can either be **full recovery back up** or **incremental backup**.
-   **Best Practice** it is recommended that a backup frequency is â‰¥ desired (RPO)
    -   e.g. RPO = 6 hours , backup frequency should be every 6 hours or 3 hours to avoid data loss
    -   tradeoff â‡’ with more frequently back ups every x hour / minute:
        -   we **minimize** the loss of **data** but we increase the **cost** \$\$\$

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

-   Max tolerable length of time a system can be **down after a failure or disaster occurs.**
-   Max **tolerable time** it takes for a **system** to **recover** and **resume operations.**
-   **Maximum time from when a failure occurs through to when the business will need that system back up and running in an operational state.**

### Can be reduced via
-   careful planning.
-   monitoring.
-   notification process.
-   spare hardware.
-   trainings.
-   more efficient systems (**Virtual Machines** or **AWS**).
