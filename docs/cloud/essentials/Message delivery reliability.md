## **At-most-once semantics** ðŸ’€

- **easiest** type of semantics to achieve.
- **no delivery guarantees**.
- each message is **delivered** **zero or once** (best case scenario) or **not at all**.

The **easiest** type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.

## **At-least-once semantics ðŸ‘¯**

-  **improvement** on **at-most-once semantics**.
-  **messages** may be **duplicated** but **they can't be lost**.
-  good in scenarios where **deduplication** is possible on the **consumer** side

This is an **improvement** on **at-most-once semantics**. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.

## **Exactly-once semantics ðŸ”’:**Â 

- more secure in terms of **data integrity**.
- message can **neither be lost** nor **delivered twice**.
- Itâ€™s also the **hardest** to achieve.

The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. Itâ€™s also the hardest to achieve.
